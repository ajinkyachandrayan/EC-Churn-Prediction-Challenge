# EC-Churn-Prediction-Challenge
ENGIE Entreprises &amp; Collectivités is a gas and power supplier for the French B2B market (businesses and local communities). French B2B market is about 160 TWh gas and 180 TWhpower.  Our clients are segmented in two parts: large accounts on the one side, and middle-market on the other side.   Since the end of gas and power regulated tariffs, our competitors have multiplied. In order to get sales stability and profitability, E&amp;C need to differentiate on client care.  Many middle-market contracts have a clause of tacit renewal, which means that they are automatically renewed unless the Client expressly asks Engie to terminate it. To terminate a tacit contract, the Client needs to send Engie a termination letter within 2 months before the contract due date.   Engie’s mission is to minimize as far as possible the number of these churners ( = clients which terminate their contract). In order to identify “at-risk” clients, they need to build a model for churn prediction, 2 or 3 months before the contract due date. This is your mission if you accept it!   Thanks to this solution, the teams may launch specific marketing actions on the identified “at-risk” clients, and then reduce the churn rate on B2B contracts when they get to the due date.
